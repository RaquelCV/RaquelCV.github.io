   <font color="Black"> <p>One of the very first projects we did in computer science with Tinkercad was building a house. Through this project we were able to learn more about the different features and tools available on Tinkercad. I created a very simple house. The house has windows and has furniture inside. Alongside a fence and small bushes surrounding the house, the house also has a garden and a bird bath. The garden and the bird bath were both created by other users, but one of the skills I was able to learn was how to incorporate others work into mine. Creating this house was very fun and definitely helped me learn how to use Tinkercad. Take a look at some of the picture down below.  </p>
