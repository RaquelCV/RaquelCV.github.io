    <font color="Black" <p>One of my favorite projects done with Tinkercad was creating my own vehicle. I decided to make a simple school bus. One of the hardest thing believe it or not was coming up with what type of vehicle I was going to do. Once I settled on a school bus, I had to decide the basic shapes that would make up my school bus. One of the more difficult tasks of this project was making sure the school bus was actually printable. The five requirements for something to be printable are the object is water tight, all of the shapes are grouped, there is no small detail, there are no holes, and it has supports. With all of these things to consider, I tried my best to make sure the school bus was printable which is why youâ€™ll see down below that it is split into different parts. All in all this school bus was very fun to make. </p>
