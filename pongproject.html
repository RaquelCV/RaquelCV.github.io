    <p>One of the many projects we did when using Arduino was creating some sort of machine/object that had to get a ping pong ball over a net. My partner and I decided to create a small car, which we named Fork Lift without the Lift. Building this car had its ups and downs. One of the biggest challenges when creating this car was the coding. The code was really hard to make work. One of the main issues we had was making the car go reverse and adding a button to the code. With a lot of perseverance, I was able to add a button to the code that when pressed would make the car run. </p>
